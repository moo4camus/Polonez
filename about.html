			<p>George Burzynski grew up on his family owned farm in Poland. As a child one of his favorite activities was to cook alongside of his grandmother who taught him traditional Polish dishes such as czarnina, bigos and pierogi. In Poland he earned a Masterâ€™s Degree in Economics. Seeking a better life he left Poland and immigrated to the US in 1980 carrying with him his love of cooking, his recipes and a dream to one day open a restaurant featuring the authentic Polish dishes taught to him by his grandmother. In 1983 George realized his dream and opened Polonez Restaurant located on South Sixth Street in Milwaukee. Today Polonez Restaurant is located in St. Francis, WI, where George still prepares the traditional Polish dishes taught to him by his grandmother as well as numerous American favorite dishes all perfected over 30 years of owning and operating Polonez Restaurant.</p>
